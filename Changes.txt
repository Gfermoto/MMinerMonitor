v2.7
- Fixed a problem with the web code that would trigger if you have less than 3 Ants.
- Fixed multiple problems with the web reboot code.  I don't see how it would have ever worked.  Apparently I broke this at some point.
- Added more exception handling logic to hopefully catch odd errors instead of throwing the awful .Net default messages.
- Hopefully addressed some issues that would occur if you entered your Ant's DNS name (antminer1) instead of the IP address.  This is theoretical 
  functionality, for best results use an IP address.
- Changed to use the last two parts of the IP address (0.90) instead of the last part (90) to allow you to have Ants on multiple subnets without
  them walking on each other.  That is, 192.168.0.90 and 192.168.0.91 will now work properly.
- Changed to use and store the port of the Ant address, so those using the Web scraping API on a non standard port will still be able to use it.
- Changed the pushing of pool info to work if you don't have all 3 pools populated.  

v2.6
- Added some exception logic to the routine that retrieves the Ant userid and passwords.  There appears to be some cases where somehow those entries
are completely missing, which can cause problems in multiple places.  Those places include rebooting your Ants, or clicking on an Ant in the config grid.  
Now if those routines are called and the data is missing, it'll create it with the defaults.

v2.5
- Fixed the problem with right clicking on the header bar causing an error.
- Changed the default startup position to be to be top left, since center screen doesn't seem to work.
- Fixed the problem that would cause errors each refresh if one or more miners didn't respond properly.

v2.4
- Added the ability to shutdown an S2.  Note this is a one way operation, you'll have to manually power cycle it to bring it back.
- Added the ability to update pool info on one or more Ants.  Note this only works with S2s by default!  You'll need to modify the cgminer config on S1s to allow SSH API access for it to work on S1s.

v2.3
- Added a hashrate total to the title bar
- Added the ability to reboot multiple ants at once, by using the selection bar
- Added a new "low fan" alert for both S1 and S2s
- Fixed the problem with reboots not working for S2s.
- Changed the default startup position to be center screen.

v2.2
- Changed the hash rates, HFan, HTemp, and freq columns to be numeric fields so that they sort properly.
- Added a new column ACount, showing the number of alerts for that Ant.  Sort by that column to have those with alerts bubble to the top.
	- Note that the glyph that shows which column is sorting, and which way it's sorting, only shows if the column header is wide enough.
- Added a tooltip text for the Pools cell to show more pool info: pool #, URL, User, and status (Alive/Dead).  Put the cursor over the Pools column for the tooltip for that Ant.  
- Added the ability to keep separate userid/passwords for each Ant, one set for SSH, and one set for Web.
	- Note that existing users will have all their web usernames/pws set to what you had stored there when it was just one field.
- Fixed the problem with multiple alerts for one Ant not being properly handled.
- Added an option to show the selection column on the Ant display grid.
- Added the ability to reboot Ants via SSH.  Notes:
	- There is a new alert type "Reboot Ants that trigger XCount alerts". 
	- While auto reboots by XCount alert triggers work for both Web and API, only the API one uses the SSH call.
	- There is also a reboot governor to prevent ant from being rebooted too often.  It defaults to 30 minutes.
	- Ants to can be manually rebooted by right clicking the row and choosing the Reboot option.
	- Reboots are logged in the log tab.

v2.1
- Added some more error handling and debug code around the API logic.
- Enabled alerts for the web screenscraping logic (non API).
- Fixed a typo that would complain about an S2 temp alert not being set when it was S1 turned on not S2.
- Visual change to make it clear how to add Ant addresses, and the local IP address is for scanning, nothing else.
- Added an email governor to prevent email alert spam.  Set to this minimum time between EMail alerts.  Note this runs by Ant, and defaults to 10 minutes.
- Added a difficulty columns to the Ant output grid.  It assumes the last difficulty for the first "Alive" pool is the right one.
- Added the ability for it to remember column positions.
- Added single instance logic, to prevent you from accidentally running more than one at a time.

v2.0a
- Enabled the email support.  The code was there, just not plugged in.

v2.0
- Added more errorhandling and logging, especially around the new alert logic.  
- Added email support.  This is untested, but working code that came M's Pool Monitor.

v1.9
- Added basic alert functionality:
	- You can trigger alerts on Fan speed being too high, Hash speed being too low, Temperature being too high, or XCount too High.
	- There are separate thresholds for S1s and S2s.
	- Alerts can show a notification popup from the notification bar (on by default), an annoying separate window popup (off by default), highlight the field that triggered the alert (on by default), and/or start a process (off by default).  
	- The process can be anything Windows recognizes that you can run from the Start menu, like a sound clip.
	- Alerts only apply to queries done via the API.  The web (screen scrape) functionality does not have it, and unless someone says they need it, I likely won't be adding it.  
	- Alerts counts also show in the title bar.
- This now uses a notification icon and will minimize to your notification bar when you close it.  To exit it, right click it and click Exit.
- Fixed a problem that could cause an infinite loop if an Ant partially responded to an API request.
- Added more text to the title bar, indicating how many Ants responded to the poll request.

v1.8
- Fixed the problem with the vertical scrollbar being off the screen and unusable.

v1.7
- Fixed it not saving column width sizes.  

v1.6
- Added the ability to use the cgminer API instead of the webbrowser control.  Notes:
	- This option is now default for new users.  
	- By default this will only work if your Ants are on the same subnet (eg 192.168.0.x) as your machine, or if you're reconfigured your 	  Ants to allow API access outside of your subnet.
	- Rebooting your Ants doesn't work when using the API.  At some point in the future I may add SSH support to be able to reboot via 	  	  SSH.
	- Web browser fuctionality is still there and can be used if desired.  At the moment the only reason why I see you'd want to do this 		  is to access Ants outside of your internal network.
	- Scanning for Ants still uses browser logic.  I intend to change that in a future version.
- Added a Reject % and Stale % column.  This is only visible when using the API.
- Added a HFan (high fan) column.  Shows only the highest fan speed.
- Added a HTemp (high temp) column.  Shows only the highest temp.
- Added an XCount column.  This is the total number of Xs or dashes you have across all your chains.
- Removed the browser tabs.
- Added the ability to abort the scan for Ants.


v1.5
- Added support for S2s
- Added logic to prevent auto rebooting more than once every 15 minutes
- Added a Freqs column to show the frequences of the Ant chains
- Readded the Browser tabs for troubleshooting purposes.  These are real live browser tabs showing what's going on, and *are* usable.

v1.4
- Removed the ability to resize the font.  It caused problems for too many people.
- Removed the ability to control how many browser instances you want to use.  It's back to as it was in 1.2, fixed at 3.  This also caused problems for some people.
- Redid the Ant grid to massively reduce the amount of space the fields take up.
- Added the ability to hide columns in the Ant grid.

v1.3
- Added the ability to resize the font.  The grid doesn't seem to auto resize nicely for all fonts, some manual effort may be required for really large or really small fonts.
- Added the ability to specify how many browser instances you want to run to keep an eye on your Ants.  The higher the number, the faster it'll go, but the more memory it will use.
- Added a log tab to show timing information, when an Ant is rebooted, and other info I might find useful to add.

v1.2
- Makes the refresh rate as customizable as you want.  Enter the value you want and pick seconds, minutes, or hours.  You won't see the new value until the next refresh, so click on the refresh button for it to take effect sooner.  Note that you can set a value too small.  I wouldn't go lower than 5, maybe even 10 seconds.
- Fixes the problem with it not working properly with Ants set to less than 3 pools.  Note that it still requires atleast one pool.
