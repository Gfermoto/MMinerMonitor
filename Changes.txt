v1.9
- Added basic alert functionality:
	- You can trigger alerts on Fan speed being too high, Hash speed being too low, Temperature being too high, or XCount too High.
	- There are separate thresholds for S1s and S2s.
	- Alerts can show a notification popup from the notification bar (on by default), an annoying separate window popup (off by default), highlight the field that triggered the alert (on by default), and/or start a process (off by default).  
	- The process can be anything Windows recognizes that you can run from the Start menu, like a sound clip.
	- Alerts only apply to queries done via the API.  The web (screen scrape) functionality does not have it, and unless someone says they need it, I likely won't be adding it.  
	- Alerts counts also show in the title bar.
- This now uses a notification icon and will minimize to your notification bar when you close it.  To exit it, right click it and click Exit.
- Fixed a problem that could cause an infinite loop if an Ant partially responded to an API request.
- Added more text to the title bar, indicating how many Ants responded to the poll request.

v1.8
- Fixed the problem with the vertical scrollbar being off the screen and unusable.

v1.7
- Fixed it not saving column width sizes.  

v1.6
- Added the ability to use the cgminer API instead of the webbrowser control.  Notes:
	- This option is now default for new users.  
	- By default this will only work if your Ants are on the same subnet (eg 192.168.0.x) as your machine, or if you're reconfigured your 	  Ants to allow API access outside of your subnet.
	- Rebooting your Ants doesn't work when using the API.  At some point in the future I may add SSH support to be able to reboot via 	  	  SSH.
	- Web browser fuctionality is still there and can be used if desired.  At the moment the only reason why I see you'd want to do this 		  is to access Ants outside of your internal network.
	- Scanning for Ants still uses browser logic.  I intend to change that in a future version.
- Added a Reject % and Stale % column.  This is only visible when using the API.
- Added a HFan (high fan) column.  Shows only the highest fan speed.
- Added a HTemp (high temp) column.  Shows only the highest temp.
- Added an XCount column.  This is the total number of Xs or dashes you have across all your chains.
- Removed the browser tabs.
- Added the ability to abort the scan for Ants.


v1.5
- Added support for S2s
- Added logic to prevent auto rebooting more than once every 15 minutes
- Added a Freqs column to show the frequences of the Ant chains
- Readded the Browser tabs for troubleshooting purposes.  These are real live browser tabs showing what's going on, and *are* usable.

v1.4
- Removed the ability to resize the font.  It caused problems for too many people.
- Removed the ability to control how many browser instances you want to use.  It's back to as it was in 1.2, fixed at 3.  This also caused problems for some people.
- Redid the Ant grid to massively reduce the amount of space the fields take up.
- Added the ability to hide columns in the Ant grid.

v1.3
- Added the ability to resize the font.  The grid doesn't seem to auto resize nicely for all fonts, some manual effort may be required for really large or really small fonts.
- Added the ability to specify how many browser instances you want to run to keep an eye on your Ants.  The higher the number, the faster it'll go, but the more memory it will use.
- Added a log tab to show timing information, when an Ant is rebooted, and other info I might find useful to add.

v1.2
- Makes the refresh rate as customizable as you want.  Enter the value you want and pick seconds, minutes, or hours.  You won't see the new value until the next refresh, so click on the refresh button for it to take effect sooner.  Note that you can set a value too small.  I wouldn't go lower than 5, maybe even 10 seconds.
- Fixes the problem with it not working properly with Ants set to less than 3 pools.  Note that it still requires atleast one pool.
